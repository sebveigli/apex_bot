# Apex Bot for Discord

Apex Bot for Discord is a currently in-development stage Bot that will run on Discord, allowing for several features revolving around the newest title from Respawn, Apex Legends.

The bot will be run in production globally, with the ability to invite the bot to your own Discord servers to make use of all the features. However, the source for this bot can always be found here, in case that you would like to deploy locally.

Instructions will be added here for both routes when the bot is in a ready stage. 

Planned Features:

- Basic Stat Tracking
  - Currently Respawn do not officially support a live API for stats, therefore this project will be using https://mozambiquehe.re/ as the endpoint.
  
- Stats Lookup
  - Check the progression of your stats since the bot has been live, or for a custom range of time.

- Squads
  - Join your friends in an official team, and compete for the global/server squad leaderboard positions.

- Leaderboards (solo/squads)
  - Have global and server side leaderboards for the difference stats that are able to be tracked (kills, damage, top 3 etc.)

- Tournaments (local/global)
  - Have the ability to start/run/administrate tournaments, including formats used in previous official tournaments (e.g. Twitch Rivals, Code Red). Allow regular users of the bot to set local tournaments, and allow the admins of the bot to set global level tournaments (these get announced to all servers, and anyone can join). 

- Web UI
  - Eventually, I will design and implement a webUI where all the administration tasks and be carried out via a web application rather than through standard Discord commands.
